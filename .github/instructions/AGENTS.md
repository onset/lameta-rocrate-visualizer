To verify something, use chrome-devtools-mcp to inspect the app in a browser.
Never run tests in watch mode.
If you run the dev server, run it as a background process.
Be hesitant to make decisions that may be counter to the instructions I gave you. Feel free to just stop and ask.
Where possible, start a task by creating a unit test that demonstrates the problem or the new feature. For example, anything related to creating the Mermaid JSON should be able to be unit tested.
Check to see if the server is running before starting it, it's normally at port 5173. If you have to start the dev server yourself, do it as a background task. But in any case, Do not wait for it to end!!!!!! It is a server. It is designed not to end. You have to just move forward with what you are trying to do.
